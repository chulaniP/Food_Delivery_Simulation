# Food_Delivery_Simulation
Simulation baseed case study of a realistic system  where performance plays a critical role.
Performance Metrics
Tracked in metrics:
•	delivery_times – time from order arrival to delivery completion
•	dispatch_delays – wait time between food ready and rider pickup
•	throughput – total delivered orders
Computed statistics:
•	Average delivery time
•	Average dispatch delay
•	Total orders completed
Brief Usage instructions for use of code
This Python simulation models a food delivery platform that processes orders, prepares food, assigns riders, and delivers orders using an event-driven simulation approach.

Output Metrics
After running, the simulation prints summary statistics:
•	Orders completed – total number of orders delivered
•	Average delivery time – time from order placement to delivery
•	Average dispatch delay – time from food being ready to rider pickup
•	Total simulation time

How to Run
1.	Save the file as Food_Delivery_simulation.py
2.	Run it in your terminal or IDE:
python Food_Delivery_simulation.py
